App Description

The Patient Information App is a simple Android application designed to collect and manage basic patient details efficiently. It allows users to enter information such as name, 
age, phone number, gender, illness type, and appointment date through interactive UI components. The entered data is displayed on a second screen using Intents, and the app 
provides quick options to call, send SMS, or email a doctor after confirmation via a DialogBox. This application demonstrates practical implementation of Android UI design, 
data transfer between activities, and real-time communication features.
